<h3>Beleriand</h3>


<p>Your task is to implement Beleriand RPG game. In the game, Legolas is in Beleriand full of orks. Legolas has to destroy the orks before his elfbread runs out and the orks can find and kill him. Legolas can't see the orks while he is running, so he is blind until he stops. With one move, Legolas can run as many steps as he wants, but he has to eat one elfbread after each run (not step! A run consists multiple steps).</p>

<p>The game situation, i.e. Beleriand, Legolas and the orks are shown in text form. The first line in the print output tells how many runs Legolas has left (that is to say, how much elfbread has left). After that, the print output shows Legolas and ork positions, which in turn are followed by the game map. In the example below, you see Legolas (<code>@</code>) and three orks (<code>o</code>); in this case, Legolas has enough elfbread for fourteen moves.</p>

<p>Hint: Take your time to design and plan. For implementation use maven, and write unit tests!</p>

<p>The example above shows Legolas has enough elfbreads for 14 runs. Legolas <code>@</code> is located at <code>1 2</code>. Note that the coordinates are calculated starting from the high left corner of the game board. In the map below, the character <code>X</code> is located at <code>0 0</code>, <code>Y</code> is at <code>2 0</code> and <code>Z</code> is at <code>0 2</code>.</p>

<pre>

<p>The user (Legolas) can move by giving a sequence of commands and pressing Enter. The commands are:</p>
<ul><li><code>w</code> - go up</li>
    <li><code>s</code> - go down</li>
    <li><code>a</code> - go left</li>
    <li><code>d</code> - go right</li>
</ul><p>When the user commands are executed (the user can give many commands at once), a new game situation is drawn. If the elfbread reaches 0, the game ends and the text <code>YOU LOSE</code> is printed on the board.
</p>

<p>The orks move randomly in the game, and they take one step for each step Legolas takes. If Legolas and a ork run into each other (even momentarily) the ork is destroyed. If an ork tries to step outside the board, or into a place already occupied by another ork, the move is not executed. When all the orks are destroyed, the game ends and it prints <code>YOU WIN</code>.</p>

<p>In order to help the tests, create the class <code>Beleriand</code> in your game, with:</p>

<p>
</p><ul><li>the constructor <strong><code>public Beleriand(int length, int height, int orks, int moves, boolean orksMove)</code></strong>
    <p>the values <code>length</code> and <code>height</code> represent the dimension of Beleriand (always a rectangle); <code>orks</code> stands for the initial number of orks (the positions of the orks can be decided randomly); <code>moves</code> determines the initial number of moves; and if <code>orksMove</code> is <code>false</code>, the orks do not move.</p></li>
    <li>the method <strong><code>public void run()</code></strong>, which starts the game</li>
</ul><p><em>Attention!</em> Legolas starts the game in the position 0,0!</p>
<p><em>Attention!</em> Legolas and the orks can not move out of Beleriand and two orks cannot step into the same place!</p>

<p>Below, you find a couple of examples to help you to understand the situation better:</p>
